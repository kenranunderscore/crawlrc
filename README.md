# crawlc

This is my personal Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup (DCSS) config file. Right now, a huge part of it is copied from [gammafunk](github.com/gammafunk)'s rc file in his dcss-rc repository.

There's some TODO's:
- Customize the color scheme: I'm not that happy with how the colors are right now. E.g. there's little yellow used, which is one of the few colors that really stand out from the rest.
- Write my own Lua method to set a target skill level that works differently from gammafunk's target_skill()
- Customize some of the wall glyphs (I don't like the # walls)
